# E01b-Smiles
My program here is being used to desplay an image through simple coding of the quardinates. Using those quardinates, as well as adjusting image sizes, I am able to create the smiley face that I was asked to make. In main3, I changed the shape of the eyes so they matched the example better which was not in the lines of code that I was asked to change, but i did not do this for the fourth simply to follow directions. I was able to place my images in a cohesive image and even play with making an entire grid of images. being able to create an image in this software is what should allow me to make grafics for a game.
